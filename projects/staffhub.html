      <h2 class="py-4">Overview</h2>
      <p>Staffhub is a cloud HRIS software from Otto International (Oi) with core HR functions, recruitment,
        training,payroll, etc. My part of the project was to enhance the performance and remuneration modules. This
        project was built and supported over <a href="https://www.employeeconnect.com/" target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">EmployeeConnect's (EC) HRIS software</a>. Additionally, updating Staffhub's theme to the
        company's brand colours was also my role as the public facing website of Oi was a project I worked on.</p>
      <p>The frontend was developed with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Basic (.NET), and ASP.NET, with the backend using
        Microsoft IIS and MS SQL.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 class="py-4">Challenges</h2>
      <p>As Staffhub was meant to be used regularly by many of the users in Oi, I had to ensure the features added to
        the performance and remuneration modules would not jeopardise the core HR functions. Walking into this solo with
        HR behind my back with requirements and deadlines as well as grasping the unfamiliar .NET technology has given
        me lots of pressure to make this work. This project required me to prioritise tasks, liaise with stakeholders on
        tasks during the timeframe, and utilise online resources to better understand the tech.</p>

      <h4>Front-End</h4>
      <p>With the recent rebranding of Oi, changes to the theme were needed.</p>

      <h4>Performance Module</h4>
      <p>Before a performance period starts, HR will start to create a review template for the review period. This
        includes adding participants that need to be evaluated and creating metrics for what the participant should be
        evaluated on. Once the performance review begins, the 2 types of users involved are: participant and evaluator.
        The evaluator can add ratings, weightings, and comments to metrics while the participant can only add comments
        to their metrics.</p>
      <p>What EC provides in their performance module is a <a
          href="https://www.employeeconnect.com/employee-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">simplified
          system</a> that should work with many other companies' requirements. Luckily that is the case with us here and
        most of the features added are quality of life changes.
      </p>
      <p>The performance module has gone through 3 phases where each phase starts a month before the performance period:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase 1 (Essentials)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic performance calculation.</li>
          <li>Show, hide, and change items.</li>
          <li>Convert performance results to performance descriptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Phase 2 (QoL Changes)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Making fields required.</li>
          <li>Limit total weighting.</li>
          <li>Create custom page reports for HR to view results clearer.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Phase 3 (HR Strategy Change)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a library of goals for managers to set goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h4>Remuneration Module</h4>
      <p>Like the performance module, HR will start to prepare the review worksheet a couple months before the review
        period. This includes adding participants, checking the salary data is correct, and writing down notes for
        evaluators. Once the review period starts, the workflow would start off with the evaluator inputting their team
        members salary increment which is then followed by two approvers that are the evaluator's manager and the head
        of the profit centre.</p>
      <p>EC has <a href="https://www.employeeconnect.com/hris-remuneration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">provided a
          skeleton</a> of a remuneration module during a review period. For phase 1, other than HR's requirements, the
        main feature lacking was the process after the review period. This was tackled by allowing HR to push the newly
        approved salaries to the salary table for payroll to pick up when needed. For the employees, a page was created
        for employees to view their salary letter. The following changes were quality of life changes as observed during
        phase 1.</p>
      <p>The remuneration module has gone through 2 phases where each phase starts a few months before the salary review
        period:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase 1 (Essentials)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic recommended salary and bonus based on year of service, employee performance, and business
            performance.</li>
          <li>Add an additional approval process for CO's and Directors.</li>
          <li>Push the new salary for payroll to be ready to use.</li>
          <li>A page for employees to view their salary letter.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Phase 2 (QoL Changes)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic total values.</li>
          <li>Freezing first row and column headers.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
