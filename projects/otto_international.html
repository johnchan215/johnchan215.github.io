      <h2 class="py-4">Overview</h2>
      <p>As Otto International (Oi) <a href="https:ottoint.com/our-rebranding-1264/" target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer">rebranded out from
          Hermes Europe
          in 2019</a>, there was a need to create a new public facing website to
        attract new vendors, customers, and hiring prospects. Undertaking this project as the sole developer, I
        collaborated closely with a designer to curate engaging content. With Human Resources and the Communications
        team
        being the stakeholders of this project, the primary requirements were to create a front facing website that
        allows
        our Communications team to periodically release key updates as well as a place for potential hiring candidates
        to
        learn more about the company's culture. WordPress (WP) was used as our Content Management System (CMS) since it
        has proven to be an efficient tool to tackle the given requirements.

      <h2 class="py-4">Components</h2>
      <h4>Front-End</h4>
      <p>The design style that resonated with the designer and me was a dynamic responsive box design. Dynamic to make
        the
        content more engaging, responsive to fit on all screen sizes, and box for the cleaner look. With this design in
        mind, we started on a rough wireframe which can be found under this section. A featured image placed on the top
        of
        each page was also included to attract visitors with a personalized feel to the subject of the page.</p>
      <p>Like <a href="./mylearning.html" target="_blank">MyLearning</a>, I have adopted
        Elementor for this project
        although it was the first time using
        <a href="https://elementor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elementor</a>. With my previous knowledge of
        web design,
        transferring my skills to Elementor was
        not very difficult. Even with the tight deadline, the abundance of widgets to choose from has accelerated the
        implementation process.

      <h4>Job Opening</h4>
      <p>To fulfill the requirement of a place for potential hiring candidates to learn more about the company's
        culture,
        a careers page has been created which also incorporates a job opening section that works together with the
        company's LinkedIn. Discussing with the HR stakeholder, we decided to use the plugin <a
          href="https://wpjobopenings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WP Job Openings</a>. It contains all the
        necessary features
        we
        needed as well as being developer
        friendly which helped in creating some custom metadata on the job openings. Since the Career page and job
        openings
        section, they have become the most viewed pages after the homepage plus it has also job openings more official
        as
        they are hosted on the company website.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h4>SEO</h4>
      <p>Being the public facing website for Otto International, SEO is important for user acquisition. With the use of
        <a href="https://rankmath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rank Math</a>
        and integrating it with Google Search Console and Google Analytics, it has made it easy
        to optimize, customise, and control SEO. All posts and pages are curated with keywords, job openings have been
        included to the sitemap to be indexed by search engines, and tags have been added to the page's call to action
        to
        have a better overview of user engagement. When majority of Direct traffic comes from face-to-face meetings with
        customers and no follow links from the Intranet, Organic Search comes up as the second-best source of traffic
        with
        a 54% difference compared to Direct traffic.
      </p>
      <h4>Newsletter</h4>
      <p>A place for the Communications team to periodically releasing key updates is another important requirement for
        the public facing website. Making good use of WP's posts, releasing “articles” is the foundation of WP as it was
        originally built as a blogger website. With Elementor, these posts can follow a template to keep all posts to
        look
        the same. With the native feature of posts in WP and Elementor's template feature, we have a newsroom. Now comes
        the question on how we can let our customers or candidates know of new company updates. As the Communications
        team
        already has a subscription to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MailChimp</a>, it has been decided to use MailChimp for monthly newsletters. As every
        WP
        site has an RSS feed, we can feed the site's RSS feed to MailChimp to easily fetch the main content and images
        which is essentially what is needed for any newsletter.
